### Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurological brain disorder marked by dementia and neurological dysfunction that affects memory, behavioral patterns, and reasoning. Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable disease that primarily affects people over 40. Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed through a manual evaluation of a patient’s MRI scan and neuropsychological examinations. Deep Learning (DL) has pioneered new approaches to automate medical image diagnosis. In this study, we classify AD using MRI images from the Kaggle dataset by applying CNN architecture and also analyze its efficiency. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a significant class imbalance problem, and we exploited a synthetic oversampling technique to evenly distribute the image among the classes to prevent the problem of class imbalance. We then evaluate the model against precision, recall, Area under the Curve, and loss.
